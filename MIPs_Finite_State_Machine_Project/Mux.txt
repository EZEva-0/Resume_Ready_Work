/*
This mux design was adapted from given code by the professor. It uses a single control singal to determin which input to pass. It is satisfactory for all 5 multiplexers in the design

Ironically, it is actually not sufficent for every mux, as Mux0 requires, as sepcifed by the Mips Diagram, smaller input and output wires.

Sel is a control signal which determines which of the two inputs are to be sent to the output Out.
In1, In2 - The input ports

module Mux(Out, Sel, In1, In2);
	output reg [31:0] Out;
	input [31:0] In1, In2;
	input Sel; // Selector signal
	
	always @(Sel, In1, In2)
	case (Sel) // a 2 -> 1 multiplexor
		0: Out <= In1;
		1: Out <= In2;
