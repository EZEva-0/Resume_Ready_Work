/*
This is the shift Left module, while a full module
is likely not needed, and this operation could be
done at the start of nessesary modules, they are
clearly unique, full modules in the mips diagram.
Given an address, (shiftValue), shift it left by 2 bits, then pass it to shiftedValue.
(I admit this is poor naming scheme, but I thought it sounded cool and serves me well, I've never gotten them mixed up. However, if I were to properly show this off as a project, excluding this particular graded project, oddly enough, I would try to replace the names with something more descriptive. )
