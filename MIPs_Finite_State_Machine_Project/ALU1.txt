/*
ALU1 a simple adder, adding the result of a previous ShiftLeft2 module and an adder Module, passing the result to another mux for further access. This adder is used principlaly in branching and jump instructions.

The name is poor I understand, but I intially misread the mips diagram and assumed this was a full ALU module, and when I realized my mistake I was so overcome with laughter that I just decided to keep it. It's the real ALU! The other one is a faker!
