# Resume_Ready_Work
The following are list of projects, assignments, and work that I have deemed worthy of showing off, take a look around!

The Folder Titled Linux_Week08, is a small collection of homework assignments from a C programming Course in a Linux Environment.
This holds very simple C programs that run on Linux systems, and show I have experience in Linux, specifically Bash, C programming, and basic Shells.

The Folder Titled Chatbot_Project is a simple chatbot using POST and GET Json requests from a webservice. This is one of the first of projects involving http requests I have ever created, but, as it was a final project, is also among the most well-polished. 
This is a great project to look out to see how I write code, and my commenting style. 

The Folder Titled MIPS_Finite_State_Machine contains Verilog Hardware Description Language Code of a (mostly) functional MIPS instruction set processor. 
This project was very difficult, as it required programming in a hardware description language, which behaves very differently from imperative programming languages. 
Still, it was an enjoyable, if not entirely successful experience.

Don't forget to check out the repository entitled 3354-git! This was an assignment I completed in a Software engineering course. I used git in a Linux environment to push and merge changes to source code. I am still lacking experience, so if I made some mistakes or did not conform to your firm's change policies, I'm excited to learn.

I hope to add to this repository with programming projects and code that more accurately conveys my skill set, as I'm currently working on a learning scripting languages. 
Stay tuned!
